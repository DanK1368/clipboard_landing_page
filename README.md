## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: https://dank1368.github.io/clipboard_landing_page/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was quite a challenge to replicate as there are more components to the site that need to change their position during different screen sizes. It was nice to combine both flexbox and CSS Grid to adjust the position of certain components of the page.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on my mobile first approach before optimizing the layout of the components for bigger screen sizes.
My goal is to become more efficient in styling with CSS/SASS as well as using CSS Grid/Flexbox to make responsive websites.
